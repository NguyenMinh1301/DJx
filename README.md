# DJx â€“ Discord Bot (JavaScript)

**DJx** is a lightweight Discord bot created purely for learning purposes. It offers three straightforward slashâ€‘commandsâ€”`/ping`, `#avatar`, and `/play`â€”demonstrating how to interact with Discord's Gateway and voice features using **discord.js v14** and **discordâ€‘player**.

## âœ¨ Features

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/ping` | Returns the botâ€™s current WebSocket latency. |
| `/avatarÂ [user]` | Displays the avatar of the mentioned user (or your own if omitted). |
| `/playÂ <query>` | Streams the requested song/URL into the voice channel you are in. |

> **Roadmap:** queue control (skip, stop, loop), lyrics, and enhanced error handling are on the way.
